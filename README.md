## Getting started

### Installation

Install `yutil` with your preferred method:

#### deb/rpm/apk:

Download the .deb, .rpm or .apk from the [latest release] and install them with the appropriate tools.

#### Manual

Download the `.tar.gz` from the [latest release] and add the binary to your path.

#### Go users

```bash
go install github.com/amplia-iiot/yutil@latest
```

### Test installation

```bash
yutil version
```

### Quick Start

```bash
yutil help
```

#### Format

This outputs a formatted _YAML_ file or files. That includes sorting its nodes alphabetically and cleaning the format of the values:
- _Strings_ that do not need quotes to remain a primitive string lose the quotes. When quotes are needed, **single quotes** are preferred for strings with special characters. For strings containing a _number_, _boolean_ or _null_ values, **double quotes** are used. Unicode escape sequences in a string are replaced with the character.
- The proper formatting for _null_ is `null`, not `Null`. The same happens to _boolean_ values, **lowercase** is used when formatting.
- _Arrays_ maintain the order of elements, and each element appears on a new line.
- Comments are removed.

> Check the [tests](./pkg/format/content_test.go) for examples.

To see and format the content of a _YAML_ file use:

```bash
yutil format file.yml
```

Use `-o` (`--output`) option if you want to output to a file instead of _stdout_.

```bash
yutil format file.yml -o file.formatted.yml
```

By default `yutil` uses _stdin_ as _YAML_ content if available:

```bash
cat file.yml | yutil format > file.formatted.yml
```

You may ignore this input (`--no-input`) if you can't control what's piped to `yutil`:

```bash
echo "this is not a yaml" | yutil --no-input format file.yml > file.formatted.yml
```

If you want to format a _YAML_ file and store the result in the same file use in-place formatting with `-i` (`--in-place`). You may pass as many _YAML_ files as desired:

```bash
yutil -i file.yml
yutil -i file1.yml file2.yml file3.yml
```

Use `-s` (`--suffix`) to make a backup before formatting the file/s:

```bash
yutil -s .bak file1.yml file2.yml file3.yml
```

This will make a copy the files (`file1.yml.bak`, `file2.yml.bak` and `file3.yml.bak`) and save the formatted _YAML_ in the original files.

> When using `-s`, in-place formatting is implicit and there's no need to also use `-i`.

In-place formatting does not allow for _stdin_ to be used as input, if something is piped to `yutil` an error will be displayed. Use `--no-input` to ignore _stdin_ input.

#### Merge

This outputs a formatted (ordered and cleaned) _YAML_ file resulting of merging the passed yaml files (or content).

The files are merged in ascending level of importance in the hierarchy. A yaml node in the last file replaces values in
any previous file. You may pass as many _YAML_ files as desired:

```bash
yutil merge base.yml changes.yml
yutil merge base.yml changes.yml important.yml
```

Use `-o` (`--output`) option if you want to output to a file instead of _stdout_.

```bash
yutil merge base.yml changes.yml -o merged.yml
```

By default `yutil` uses _stdin_ as the first _YAML_ content:

```bash
cat base.yml | yutil merge changes.yml > merged.yml
```

You may ignore this input (`--no-input`) if you can't control what's piped to `yutil`:

```bash
echo "this is not a yaml" | yutil --no-input merge base.yml changes.yml
```

#### External configuration

You may want to always use the same config without writting the flags, `yutil` reads a _YAML_ file to configure itself from the current folder or the user home dir in these order of precedence:
- `.yutil.yaml` in current folder
- `.yutil.yml` in current folder
- `.yutil` in current folder
- `.yutil.yaml` in user home dir
- `.yutil.yml` in user home dir
- `.yutil` in user home dir

Sample configuration file:

```yaml
# Disable stdin
no-input: true
# Merge specific config
merge:
  # Merge output file
  output: /tmp/merged.yml
```

You may pass as argument the desired config file:

```bash
# Including extension to support multiple config types
./yutil version --config config.properties
```

> Supported formats: JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, envfile and Java properties config files

## Development

1. Use Golang version `>= 1.20`
2. Fork (https://github.com/amplia-iiot/yutil)
3. Run `make set-up` to install dev tools
4. Create a feature branch
5. Check changes (test & lint) with `make check`
6. Commit your changes following [Conventional Commits]
7. Rebase your local changes against the upstream _main_ branch
8. Create a Pull Request

You are welcome to report bugs or add feature requests and comments in [issues].

## Release Process

`make version` contains the steps to generate a new version. It uses `svu` to calculate the next version number based on the _git log_ and generates the [CHANGELOG.md] with `git-chglog`

Push the generated _tag_ and the _release_ workflow will generate the release.

Or you can trigger a manual run of the [_release_ workflow](https://github.com/amplia-iiot/yutil/actions/workflows/release.yml) with _preview_ set to `false` to generate the commit and tag automatically.
